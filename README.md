Our system represents a polynomial and a monum, and allows for a number of mathematical operations on them. 
Authors:
Adi Weisberg and Naomi Tsabari.

in order to understand the Computational Functions of the polynomial and the monom, we recommend reading more information from the following links: 
1. Polynomial - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial 
2. Monomial- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial

# Getting Started:
see the java docs to understands the function, If you wish to examine the correctness of the various functions in the class, you should go to the Test class and to JUnit MonomTest and PolynomTest, olso to see gui of the Polynom in class-unctionGraph.
the best option to see the project is in the main class.
